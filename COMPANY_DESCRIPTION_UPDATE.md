# Company Description and Quotes Update

## Overview
This update combines the `company_description` and `company_additional_description` fields into a single `company_description` field that supports HTML content. It also removes the `company_global_exhibition_text` field and consolidates all quotes into a `company_quotes` array. The change maintains the existing `company_years_in_business`, `company_years_label`, and `company_who_we_are_title` columns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration (002_create_about_page_table.sql)
- Removed the `company_additional_description` column from the `about_page` table
- Removed the `company_global_exhibition_text` column from the `about_page` table
- Updated `company_quotes` column to contain all quotes as a TEXT[] array
- Updated the `company_description` column to contain combined HTML content
- Modified the `get_about_page_data` function to reflect the new structure
- Updated the `update_about_section` helper function

### 2. Additional Database Migration (004_rename_company_quote_to_quotes.sql)
- Added the new `company_quotes` column as TEXT[]
- Migrated existing data from `company_quote` and `company_global_exhibition_text` to `company_quotes`
- Removed the old `company_quote` and `company_global_exhibition_text` columns
- Updated database functions to reflect the new structure

### 3. TypeScript Interfaces (src/data/about-data.ts)
- Removed `additionalDescription` property from the `CompanyInfo` interface
- Removed `globalExhibitionText` property from the `CompanyInfo` interface
- Updated `quotes` property to be a string array containing all quotes
- Maintained all other properties including `yearsInBusiness`, `yearsLabel`, and `whoWeAreTitle`

### 4. UI Component (src/about-us/components/company-intro-section.tsx)
- Updated the component to render HTML content using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Added the `rich-content` CSS class for proper styling
- Updated to handle the `quotes` array, using the first two quotes for display
- Maintained all other functionality

### 5. CSS Styles
- Utilized existing `rich-content` CSS classes for HTML content styling
- No new CSS was needed as the styles were already available

## Implementation Steps

1. Apply the database migration:
   ```sql
   -- Run the 002_create_about_page_table.sql migration (for fresh databases)
   -- OR
   -- Run the 004_rename_company_quote_to_quotes.sql migration (for existing databases)
   ```

2. Run the data update script to combine existing content:
   ```bash
   node scripts/combine-company-descriptions.js
   ```

3. Deploy the updated TypeScript and UI components

## Benefits
- Simplified data structure with a single HTML content field
- Improved maintainability by reducing duplicate fields
- Enhanced flexibility with HTML content support
- Consolidated all company quotes in a single array for easier management
- Maintained all existing functionality and data

## Testing
After deployment, verify that:
1. The company description section displays correctly with HTML formatting
2. All existing data is preserved and properly combined
3. The page renders without errors
4. The rich content styling is applied correctly
5. All company quotes are displayed properly from the array
